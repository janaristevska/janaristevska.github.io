<p>The Antalya Region, now called the "Turkish Riviera" is the place where sea, sun,
  history and nature constitute a perfect harmony and which also includes the most beautiful
  and clearest coast along Mediterranean. There are so many things to visit in Antalya.
  I have visited the Antalya Aquarium which is the second largest aquarium in Europe and
  the 5th largest in the world. It was a wonderful experience to discover the magical world
  of underwater creatures while spending a great time with my family. –êlso another thing that
  I visited and stayed in my memory is the ancient city Perge. Perge is a major historical
  attraction in the region and is only 17 kms from Antalya. It was one of the largest and
  richest cities in ancient times and became the capital of the Pamphylia region.</p>
