    <p>Hi, my name is Jana, I'm from Bitola, Macedonia. Currently, I am a 20-year-old student
        pursuing a degree in computer science at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje.
        My passion for computer science began during my primary school education and has become an integral part of my life.</p>
    <p>After completing my high school education at "Josip Broz Tito" in Bitola, I developed a strong affinity for Mathematics
        and Programming, which ultimately led me to choose computer science as my field of study. To enhance my skills,
        I have actively participated in programming courses, such as the course for object-oriented programming in Java.</p>
    <p>I like to kick-start my day with a cup of coffee. During my leisure time, I thoroughly enjoy going riding bike with
        my sisters and friends. However, my ultimate hobby is playing volleyball, as it has held a special place in my
        heart since a young age.</p>
