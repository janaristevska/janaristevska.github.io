<p>Egypt is a country located in the northeastern corner of Africa. It eventually became one of the
    intellectual and cultural centres of the Arab world. I have visited the three Pyramids of Giza which
    were built during a frenetic period of construction. The third of the Giza Pyramids is considerably
    smaller than the first two. Each massive pyramid is but one part of a larger complex, including a palace,
    temples, solar boat pits, and other features. Egypt is one of the most famous destinations for riding a
    camel in the whole world. We went on a camel ride and were exploring the desert behind the Pyramids.
    A camel ride is a must-do for anyone visiting Egypt.</p>
